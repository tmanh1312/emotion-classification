The original study we referenced for our study uses Bayes Network to classify emotions from stimulated brainwave activity. The classification consists of three categories - negative, positive, or neutral. Emotion classification based on brainwaves is an important field to explore because it can significantly enhance social interactions by enabling more empathetic and responsive communication. Furthermore, it can lead to impactful responses from advertisements by allowing marketers to tailor content to the emotional states of their audience, thus improving engagement and effectiveness. We hypothesize that using a RNN model will provide us with the highest accuracy due to the length and the sequential nature of the data. We will be validating this hypothesis using the inputs from the EEG feature readings and their outputted emotional state.â€‹
